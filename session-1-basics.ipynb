    "\n",
    "Today, ML and AI are often used synonymously, because most AI researchers use ML methods to try and achieve AI. But this has not always been the case. From the 1940s to the 1980s, the dominant paradigm in AI research was 'symbolic AI'. During this period, AI researchers tried to replicate intelligence by programming computers to manipulate symbols according to pre-programmed logical rules. Only the the 1990s did machine learning become sufficiently successful to take over.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below gives a very simple example of how early symbolic AI worked. In a symbolic AI program, you define different *objects* (or *terms* or *arguments*) and *predicates* (or *relations*). The computer can use this set of objects and predicates to describe and reason about the world:"

A binary classification problem is one in which there are only two possible answers, e.g. Is this person positive for coronavirus? Can this person speak Twi? Did Shakespeare write this play? When you have such a binary, or yes-no question, then it is common to measure two other things alongside the accuracy:\n",
