# Machine Learning for Humanists

:robot: Get the computer to do your dirty work. Basic ML methods, code and concepts for humanists.

## Welcome

In this repository you will find four Jupyter Notebooks to support a series of short workshops on basic Machine Learning methods for Humanities Scholars.

The Notebooks assume some familiarity with Python, but they are not supposed to be demanding for beginning coders. The aim of the workshops was to give participants a basic understanding of the key concepts, and some working code for them to play around with.
